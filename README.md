Swampnutz
=========
Generate and deploy a single static page from a markdown file. Partially inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/TensorNo/status/1147292248238776320).

Why is it named Swampnutz? Great question!

## Prerequisites

* Node 10+
* `npm` version 5.2.0 or higher (`npx` support required!)

## Running

### Method 1 - use `npx`
Run `npx swampnutz my_markdown_file.md`

### Method 2 - Install globally
Install globally with `npm install -g swampnutz`.

Now you can use `swampnutz markdown_file.md`. Follow the prompts to make a (https://surge.sh)[surge] account and have fun!

Optionally, you may pass in a title with `--title`

```
npx swampnutz my_markdown_file.md --title "Look at me"
```

## Purpose

To quickly publish a markdown page on the live internet with as little to no friction as possible.
